# Analysis of wildfire exceptional event submissions and increasing wildfires 
This repository contains data and findings that are part of an ongoing collaboration between MuckRock and the California Newsroom on the increasing impact of wildfire smoke on Californians' health. The data and analysis in this repository underpin visualizations and findings in TK story with TK link. 

You can find analysis for earlier work in the series in [`california-wildfire-pollution`](https://github.com/MuckRock/california-wildfire-pollution) and a full catalogue of all the data and analysis driving the investigations of MuckRock's news team in [`news-team`](https://github.com/MuckRock/news-team).

## Data 

### Exceptional Events Submissions
Data for exceptional events submissions from 2013 to 2020 originally comes from Figure 3 of the the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report *[Wildfire Smoke: Opportunities to Strengthen Federal Efforts to Manage Growing Risks](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-104723)*. The underlying data for Figure 3 was received via email from the GAO. 

## Methodology 
### Exceptional Events Submissions
For brevity and clarity, submissions of different categories — such as concurred, placed on hold, nonconcurred or under review — were aggregated together for a total number of wildfire exceptional event submissions by year.
